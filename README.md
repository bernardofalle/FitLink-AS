## Application workflow
Firstly you should pick your coaches(Personal Trainer and Nutritionist). For that, you should go to your profile, click the little star in the upper right corner, and proceed to pick the coaches based on your preferences. The displayed PT's and nutritionists are the available coaches in the database at this time.

After getting to the home page, you want to check the made available plans by your coaches. For the nutrition plan, you can check the 'Eating' section. The plan is divided by days, and the meals divided by commas (breakfast, morning snack, lunch, evening snack, dinner).
For the workout plan you can click on the 'Workout' section. In this pane, you will check your plan. You can also create a custom plan if you want to, and based on your personal preferences. This will all be stored in the firestore database, based on your user UID.

Finally, you can go to the 'Journaling' page, and start your workout! You will have an assistant cronometer, that allows you to clock your workout! When you finish your workout, you can type your body weight and the weight you lifted, this will alow us to calculate your Wilks coefficient!
